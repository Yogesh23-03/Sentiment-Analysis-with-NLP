Sentiment Analysis with NLP
This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment of a tweet as either positive or negative.

Dataset
The project utilizes the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets extracted from the Twitter API.  The tweets are pre-labeled with sentiment polarity (0 = negative, 4 = positive).

Key Features
NLP Techniques: The project employs various NLP techniques, including:

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)

Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF)

Sentiment classification using machine learning models.

Sentiment Classification: The core functionality is to accurately classify the sentiment of input text.

Model Training and Evaluation: The project includes training a classification model on the Sentiment140 dataset and evaluating its performance.

How to Use
Clone the repository.

Install the required Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, NLTK).

Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

Project Goals
Demonstrate the application of NLP techniques for sentiment analysis.

Provide a working example of building a sentiment classification system.

Achieve reasonable accuracy in classifying tweet sentiment.

Further Improvements
Experiment with different NLP techniques (e.g., word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe).

Explore different machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers).

Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

Expand the project to handle more nuanced sentiment (e.g., neutral, very positive, very negative).
